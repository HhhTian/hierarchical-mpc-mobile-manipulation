# Version 0.1 Report: Baseline MPC and Y-Axis Tracking Issue

## Overview

This document describes the first version (v0.1) of a simplified HTMPC simulation for a mobile manipulator, with a focus on the current system structure, cost function setup, visualization results, and key issues encountered‚Äîparticularly in y-axis control.

---

## 1. System Modeling

3D Robot: 2D-Base + 2D-End Effector (EE)

The state vector is defined as:

```
x = [x_b, y_b, q_ext, q_lift, vx, vy, v_ext, v_lift]
```

- `x_b, y_b`: base position
- `q_ext`: extension of End Effector (x-direction)
- `q_lift`: vertical lift (z-direction)
- `v_*`: corresponding velocities

The dynamics are double integrator-type:

```
x_next = x + dt * (A @ x + B @ u)
```

with `u = [ax, ay, a_ext, a_lift]`, and EE position is calculated as:

```
x_ee = x_b + q_ext
y_ee = y_b
z_ee = q_lift
```

---

## 2. MPC Setup

### üéØ Cost Function

The objective is to minimize:

```
J = Œ£ [ (e_k.T @ Q @ e_k) + Œª||u_k||¬≤ ]
```

Where:

- `e_k`: error between actual and reference EE position
- `Q`: diagonal weight matrix
- 'Œª': control penalty weight

No constrains currently enforced.

### Initialization of Control Sequence

The initial guess \( u_0 \) for the optimization is warm-started from the previous optimal control sequence:

\[ u^{(0)} = [u_1^{\text{prev}}, u_2^{\text{prev}}, \ldots, u_{N-1}^{\text{prev}}, u_{N-1}^{\text{prev}}] \]

This provides better convergence than a zero initialization.

---

## 3. Reference Trajectory

- End-effector (EE) target remains fixed in X and Y: \( (2.0, 0.0) \)
- Z-axis follows a smooth sinusoidal profile: \( z = 1.2 + 0.1 \sin(0.2t) \)

First set a fixed EE point to verify that the model converges, and later add more complex tasks
(Z is set this way to make it more visible in the image)

## 4. Simulation & Trouble-shooting Process
Robot Initial State: (0.0 ,0.0, 1.0, 1.2)

### step 1: first simulate

#### Initial Setting:
Cost Function:
```
J = Œ£ [ (e_k.T @ e_k) ]
```
horizon: 100

#### Result:
![ee error](results/mn4/ee_error/u11.png)
![3D trajectory of EE and Base](results/mn4/animation/u11.gif)

#### Analysis:
The model is not converge at all. Robot briefly approaches target and then moves away again, the velocity state of the robot:
![velocity](results/mn4/velocity/u11.png)
Thus, we then add u constrains

### step 2: Add penalty of u

#### Update:
New cost function:
```
J = Œ£ [ (e_k.T @ e_k) + Œª||u_k||¬≤ ]
```
first set Œª = 1

#### Result:

set z stable to eliminate sin error of z:

![velocity](results/mn4/u0.003z1.2/velocity_history.png)
![3D trajectory of EE and Base](results/mn4/u0.003z1.2/trajectory_3d.png)


#### Analysis:
The x, z positions and x, y, z velocities begin to converge, but the converged value of velocity y is not equal to 0, resulting in a y-direction velocity being present all the time, which forces the robot to continue to drift in the y-direction after it approaches the target.

The error in the y-direction is always there and getting bigger when we use different Œª's. Even when Œª=0.1 and 0.003 there was a shift of y in the opposite direction. So, even though different Œª values have an effect on the convergence of error and velocity, it doesn't seem to completely solve the case of y offset in the trajectory. So we need to consider other ways.

### step 3: increase the weight of y-error

#### Update:
We add the Q matrix to e_k and increase the weights in the y-direction
New cost function:
```
J = Œ£ [ (e_k.T @ Q @ e_k) + Œª||u_k||¬≤ ]
Œª = 0.01
```
with emphasizing y-axis tracking:
```
Q = diag([1.0, 20.0, 1.0])
```

#### Result:
![ee error](results/mn4/u0.01z1.2y20/ee_error.png)
![velocity](results/mn4/u0.01z1.2y20/velocity_history.png)
![3D trajectory of EE and Base](results/mn4/u0.01z1.2y20/trajectory_3d.png)

#### Analysis:

Even adding weights in the y-direction still doesn't eliminate this apparent y offset, which, even though it is small, will add up to a larger and larger value as time goes on

### Observation:
> Around `x ‚âà 1.0`, EE sharply deviates in y-direction, despite the reference `y_ref = 0`.

---

## 5. Issue Diagnosis

Although the cost function heavily penalizes y error, the robot still produces y deviations.

### üîç Possible Explanations:

- The model exhibits limited control authority in the y-direction, leading to the end-effector (EE) persistently deviating from the target along the lateral axis.
- Since there is no dedicated degree of freedom (DOF) for lateral extension (i.e., no q_ext_y), the y-position of the EE can only be adjusted indirectly through base movement.
- The optimizer appears to exploit this base movement to compensate for tracking errors, which may explain the abrupt and suboptimal deviations observed near convergence.

---

## 6. Next Steps

### ‚úÖ Proposed Fixes:

- **Add `q_ext_y` DOF** to allow explicit y manipulation by the EE.
- Modify the model: `n = 5`, `m = 5`
- Update `ee_position()` to compute:
  ```
  y_ee = y_b + q_ext_y
  ```

This will make the y-axis controllable similarly to x and z.

---

## 7. Summary

This version successfully builds and simulates a basic MPC controller, tracks in x/z directions well, but shows y instability. The system is now ready for structural extension to improve control capability in all three spatial directions.
